      <div class="description"> 1) In January 2025, Francis W. Parker School hosted the first annual Youth Reproductive Rights Summit in Chicago. The event featured speakers such as Illinois Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton and ACLU leader Ameri Klafeta, along with many other experts. Attendees participated in small-group discussions covering medical, legal, and social justice perspectives while connecting with organizations offering resources and opportunities for action. The summit ended with keynote speeches and reflections that inspired participants to continue advocating for reproductive rights. </div>

      <div class="description"> 2) On February 25th, 2025 the Reproductive Justice Club provided an oppurtunity to go to a symposium on human rights and the criminalization of pregnancy at Northwestern School of Law. Lunch was served at Northwestern school and members of RJC took notes during the conversation. Members were then given the chance to ask the speakers questions at the end. The talk was very educational and gave students an interesting perspective from women working in law.  </div>
